	   			<h3 class="mb-3 pb-0 text-left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size">Introduction</h3>

				<p class="lead mb-5 text-left" style="font-size: 1rem;">The following privacy policies provide important information regarding how Samurai Labs Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Samurai Labs”, “we” or “us”) process, use, collect, disclose, utilize and protect information through the use of Samurai Username Guardian - an autonomous username moderation service and Samurai Username Guardian website (“Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party services that are not under Samurai Labs’s control; those parties’ services are governed by their own privacy policies.
				
				<h3 class="mb-3 pb-0 text-left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size">Overview</h3>
		   		<p class="lead mb-5 text-left" style="font-size: 1rem;">Samurai Username Guardian is an autonomous moderation service that allows community architects or administrators (“Moderators”) to automatically moderate, keep records of infractions and perform automated actions (e.g. block).

		   		<h3 class="mb-3 pb-0 text-left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size">Information collected and how it is used</h3>
		   		<p class="lead mb-3 text-left" style="font-size: 1rem;">When Samurai Username Guardian is used by a site (“Site” or “Client”), for each username (which was previously collected by the Site from its users - “User” or “Users”) being processed by the Services, the following categories data are being stored:</p>

		   		<ul class="mb-5 mx-auto" style="font-size: 1rem;">
			   		<li>Username</li>
			   		<li>Categories</li>
			   		<li>Actions taken</li>
		   		</ul>


<p class="lead mb-3 text-left" style="font-size: 1rem;">All data is obtained from the Site - i.e. no information is obtained from the Users directly. Some of the information described above may contain personal information (“Personal Data”). The data is processed and collected to provide the Services and to improve the Services by Samurai.</p>

<h3 class="pt-5 mb-3 pb-0 text-left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size">Automated decision making</h3>

<p class="lead mb-3 text-left" style="font-size: 1rem;">Samurai Username Guardian makes automated decisions based on the Username content and responds to Infractions (i.e. responding to API calls with the information about the action to take).</p>

<h3 class="pt-5 mb-3 pb-0 text-left" style="font-weight: 700; font-size">Information Collected Automatically</h3>
